#  Another Victory for Ludwig's Poker Sport Gambling Site

* Another Victory for Ludwig's Poker Sport Gambling Site

Ludwig Von Mises is one of the most famous and celebrated economists of the 20th century. A favorite of the Austrian School of Economics, Von Mises championed the idea of free market capitalism and individual liberty. In recent years, Von Mises' legacy has been carried on by his grandson, Ludwig Von Mises Jr. who has made a name for himself in the online gambling world.

Jr.'s latest venture is Ludwig's Poker Sport, a site that specializes in Bitcoin gambling for poker enthusiasts. The site has seen great success in its short existence, with thousands of players signing up to take part in its games. Earlier this month, Ludwig's Poker Sport announced its latest victory: an agreement with gaming giant Slotland to offer its games to Slotland's players.

This agreement is a major win for Ludwig's Poker Sport, as it gives the site access to Slotland's large player base. It also marks another victory for the growing field of Bitcoin gambling: Slotland is one of the few large gaming companies to offer Bitcoin payments, and Ludwig's Poker Sport is one of only a handful of Bitcoin-based poker sites.

The agreement between Slotland and Ludwig's Poker Sport is a sign that Bitcoin gambling is becoming more mainstream. As Bitcoin continues to gain popularity and acceptance, it seems likely that we will see more agreements like this one in the future.

#  Borgata Casino NJ Releases Live Dealer Games

The Borgata Casino in Atlantic City, NJ, which is a part of the Boyd Gaming Corporation, has announced that it will be launching live dealer games in the near future. This launch will make Borgata the first casino in New Jersey to offer this type of gaming experience to its players.

The new live dealer games at Borgata will include blackjack, roulette, and baccarat. These games will all be streamed from a land-based casino in Europe, and they will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Players who are interested in trying these games out can do so by visiting Borgata's website or by downloading the casino's app.

The addition of live dealer games to Borgata's lineup is just one of many recent initiatives that the casino has undertaken in order to stay ahead of the competition. In December 2017, for instance, Borgata rolled out a new loyalty program called Club B Gold. This program awards players with points for every dollar that they spend at the casino, and it offers a wide range of benefits, including free rooms, show tickets, and food and beverage discounts.

In addition to its new loyalty program, Borgata has also been ramping up its online presence. The casino's website and app both offer a large number of slots and table games, as well as a wide variety of daily and weekly promotions. There is also an online rewards program called ClubB Connect that awards players with points for their play at the casino's online tables and slots.

With all of these new initiatives, it is clear that Borgata is doing everything possible to stay ahead of the curve in the competitive New Jersey gaming market. Players who want to experience all that this casino has to offer should definitely check it out soon!

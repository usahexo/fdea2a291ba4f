#  What are the wagering requirements at 11Bet,Mexico?

11Bet,Mexico imposes a wagering requirement of 10x the bonus amount on its bonuses. This is in line with industry standard, and means that players need to wager 10 times the value of the bonus before they are able to withdraw any winnings.

There are some important things to note about this requirement. First of all, it applies to both the bonus amount and the associated deposit amount. So, if you receive a $100 bonus, you will need to wager a total of $1,000 before you can withdraw any winnings. Secondly, the requirement must be met within 30 days of receiving the bonus. Lastly, only certain games contribute fully towards satisfying the wagering requirement. These are slots, scratch cards and keno games. All other casino games count only partially towards meeting the requirement.

The good news is that there is no maximum cash-out amount associated with 11Bet,Mexico bonuses. This means that you can potentially withdraw unlimited amounts provided you have met all other criteria (such as making a valid deposit and wagering the requisite amount).

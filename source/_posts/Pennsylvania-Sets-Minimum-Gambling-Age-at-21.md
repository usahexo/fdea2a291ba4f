#  Pennsylvania Sets Minimum Gambling Age at 21

Governor Tom Wolf on Wednesday signed into law a bill that sets the minimum gambling age in Pennsylvania at 21.

“This is about protecting Pennsylvanians,” Wolf said in a statement. “By setting the minimum gambling age at 21, we are keeping harmful and addictive products out of the hands of young people.”

The bill, which passed the state House and Senate last month, amends the state’s current gambling law to prohibit anyone under 21 from engaging in most forms of gambling, including playing lotteries, betting on horse races and casino games.

Under the new law, people 18 or older will still be able to participate in charitable gaming activities such as bingo and raffles. They also will be able to place bets on sports through licensed online sportsbooks.

Some opponents of the measure said it will push underage gamblers underground and make it more difficult for authorities to track their activities. But supporters argued that raising the minimum age will help protect young people from developing gambling addictions.

#  Pennsylvania Gaming Officials Announce New Minimum Age Requirement

On Wednesday, Pennsylvania gaming officials announced that the minimum age requirement to gamble in the state's casinos will be raised from 18 to 21. The change will go into effect on January 14, 2019.

Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) Chairman Kevin O'Toole said in a statement that the decision was made in order to better align with other states in the region. "The PGCB is committed to ensuring that all of its regulations are best-in-class and this amendment to our minimum age requirement is another example of that commitment," he said.

The PGCB also cited public health concerns as a motivating factor behind the decision, noting that underage gambling can lead to addiction and other negative consequences.

Opponents of the measure argue that it will hurt businesses and cost jobs, but supporters say it will help protect vulnerable young people.

#  Minimum Gambling Age Increased to 21 in Pennsylvania

As of January 16, 2019, the minimum gambling age in Pennsylvania increased from 18 to 21. The bill, HB 649, which was passed in November 2018, makes Pennsylvania the fourth state in the US with a minimum gambling age of 21.

Governor Tom Wolf signed the bill into law on Monday, January 14, just days before the increase was set to take effect. In a statement released on Sunday, Wolf said that “increasing the minimum age to gamble will help protect Pennsylvanians and their families from harm.”

The National Council on Problem Gambling applauded the increase, saying that it would help reduce rates of problem gambling. “This is an important step forward in protecting our citizens and our economy from the devastating consequences of problem gambling,” said Keith Whyte, executive director of the NCPG.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to more gambling-related problems among young people and will result in lost revenue for casinos and other gaming establishments. In a statement released shortly after Governor Wolf signed HB 649 into law, Dave Taylor, president of the Commonwealth Gaming Association said that “the passage of this legislation will have a devastating impact on Pennsylvania’s casino industry and jobs within it.”

Pennsylvania joins Utah, Hawaii, and Idaho as states with a minimum gambling age of 21.

#  PA Casinos Raise Minimum Age to Play to 21

Pennsylvania casinos are raising the minimum age to play to 21.

This move is being made in an attempt to protect younger players from harm.

Casinos are also making changes to their machines, in order to make it more difficult for people under 21 to gamble.

These changes come as a response to the findings of a state-commissioned study on gambling addiction.

The study found that people under 21 are especially at risk for developing a gambling addiction.

#  Gambling Age in Pennsylvania Now 21

In Pennsylvania, the legal gambling age is now 21. This new law goes into effect today, and replaces the previous gambling age of 18.

The reason for this change is that lawmakers believe that adults aged 21 are better able to make responsible decisions about gambling. They feel that this age group is more likely to understand the risks involved, and therefore be less likely to develop gambling addictions.

Opponents of the new law argue that it will simply push underage gambling underground, where it will be harder to monitor and control. They also say that adults aged 18-21 are perfectly capable of making informed decisions about gambling.

What do you think? Should the legal gambling age be raised to 21?

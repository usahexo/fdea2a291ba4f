#  Delaware and Nevada Might Not be the Only States with Legalized Gambling Anymore!

The US state of Iowa is currently in the process of legalizing gambling, with a bill that was approved by the Senate on March 29th. The bill will now head to the House for a vote.

Gambling is big business in the United States, with estimates that it generates more than $240 billion in revenue every year. This makes it one of the country’s largest entertainment industries. The main types of gambling included in this figure are casinos, sports betting, and online gambling.

While most states have some form of legalized gambling, there are a few that stand out as being particularly prominent in this industry. These states are Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey, which account for more than two-thirds of all casino revenue generated in the US.

Iowa is hoping to join this group of states with its new gambling bill. If it is passed, the state will legalize casino gambling, as well as sports betting and online gaming. This would be a major development for Iowa’s gambling market, as it currently has no casinos and just one racetrack that offers limited betting options.

The bill was met with opposition from some religious groups, who argue that legalized gambling is immoral and can lead to addiction problems. However, it was supported by Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, who said that it would bring new jobs and economic opportunities to the state.

If passed, the new law would take effect on July 1st 2019. It would allow for up to 17 casinos to be built in Iowa, as well as an online gaming platform operated by the state lottery. The legislation also includes provisions for taxing casino revenues and regulating how casinos are run.

While Iowa may be moving towards legalizing gambling, there are a few other states that could follow suit in the near future. In particular, Rhode Island and Illinois both have bills pending that would legalize sports betting.

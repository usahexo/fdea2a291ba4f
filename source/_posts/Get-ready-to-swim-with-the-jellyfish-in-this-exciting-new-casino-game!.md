#  uncover the mysteries of the jellyfish flow game and win big!

 GAMBLING has always been popular, and online casinos have taken the experience to a whole new level. One game that has become increasingly popular is jellyfish flow, which can be found at a number of different gambling websites.

WHAT IS JELLYFISH FLOW?

Jellyfish flow is an online game that simulates the motion of swimming jellyfish. The object of the game is to click on as many of the jellies as possible while they are in motion. As the player progresses through the game, the jellies move faster and more of them appear on the screen. The ultimate goal is to get as many points as possible before time runs out.

HOW TO PLAY JELLYFISH FLOW

Jellyfish flow can be played using either a computer mouse or a touch screen. To play using a computer mouse, simply use the left button to click on the jellies. To play using a touch screen, touch and hold the jellyfish you want to select until it turns green, then release your finger.

POINTS AND STAGES

In jellyfish flow, points are awarded for every jellyfish you catch. The longer you take to catch a jellyfish, the less points you will earn. There are also different stages in the game, which are identified by different colours. At each stage, you must catch a certain number of jellies in order to progress to the next stage. If you run out of time before reaching the required number of catches, you will lose one life and will have to start again from the beginning of the stage you were on. You start with three lives and can earn extra lives by catching bonuses that appear onscreen from time to time.

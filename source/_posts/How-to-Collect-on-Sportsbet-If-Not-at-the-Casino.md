For Australians, sports betting is a popular pastime. In fact, it is estimated that over $1.5 billion is gambled on sport in Australia each year. While a lot of this money is gambled through the TAB or at the casino, an increasing amount is now being wagered through online sportsbooks like Sportsbet.

One of the questions we often hear from our readers is, "How can I collect my winnings if I don't live near a casino?" In this article, we will provide some tips on how to get your winnings from Sportsbet if not at the casino.

Firstly, it is important to note that there are a few different ways to collect your winnings from Sportsbet. The most common way is by requesting a payout through their website. However, you can also collect your winnings at a physical Sportsbet outlet if you are located near one. Alternatively, you can have your winnings transferred directly into your bank account.

If you would like to request a payout through the Sportsbet website, simply login to your account and go to the "My Account" page. From there, select "Withdrawal/Payment" and follow the prompts. You will need to specify how much money you would like to withdraw and choose a payment method. Be sure to keep in mind any applicable fees associated with each payment method.

If you would like to collect your winnings at a physical Sportsbet outlet, then you will need to print out a withdrawal form and take it along with photo ID to the outlet. The minimum withdrawal amount at an outlet is $50 and you can only collect your winnings in person; they cannot be transferred directly into your bank account.

Finally, if you would prefer for Sportsbet to transfer your winnings directly into your bank account, then you will need to provide them with some information including your bank account number and SWIFT code (or BSB and account number for Australian banks). This process usually takes between 1-3 business days to complete.

Whichever method you choose for collecting your winnings from Sportsbet, be sure to familiarize yourself with their terms and conditions first. There may be certain restrictions or fees associated with certain payment methods which you should be aware of before making your selection.

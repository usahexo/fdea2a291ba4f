#  Nevada and Delaware Legalize Online Gambling

Nevada and Delaware are the latest states to legalize online gambling. The laws went into effect in late December 2013.

Nevada is home to Las Vegas, the gambling capital of the world. Delaware has three casinos: Harrington Raceway and Casino, Dover Downs Hotel & Casino, and The Casino at Ocean Downs.

Now that online gambling is legal in both states, people can gamble from their homes or phones. Gamblers can also place bets on sports games, something that was not allowed in Nevada before the new law went into effect.

Online gambling generates billions of dollars in revenue each year. In 2012, for example, $3.5 billion was wagered on poker alone. With Nevada and Delaware now allowing online gambling, that number is likely to grow in the years to come.

#  New Jersey and Nevada legalize online gambling

On October 10, 2018, New Jersey and Nevada became the first states in the United States to legalize online gambling. Both states passed legislation that allows residents to gamble online, including playing casino games and betting on sports.

The passage of the legislation was a long time in the making. New Jersey first introduced a bill to legalize online gambling in 2013, but it failed to pass the legislature. The state renewed its efforts in 2017, and this time the bill was signed into law by Governor Phil Murphy.

Similarly, Nevada had been trying to legalize online gambling for years. In fact, the Nevada legislature passed a bill legalizing online poker back in 2013, but then-Governor Brian Sandoval vetoed it. The state tried again in 2017, and this time the bill was signed into law by Governor Steve Sisolak.

One of the reasons both states were successful in passing their legislation is that they partnered with other states to create a larger market. New Jersey partnered with Delaware and Pennsylvania, while Nevada partnered with Oregon. This gives players in each state access to more games and betting options.

So what does this mean for residents of New Jersey and Nevada? Pretty much everyone over the age of 21 will now be able to gamble online. You’ll be able to play casino games like blackjack, roulette, and slots, as well as bet on sports matches. The only exception is that people living in Nevada cannot gamble on poker sites that are based outside of the state.

One thing to keep in mind is that not all casinos or sportsbooks have started offering online gambling yet. So far, only 11 casinos in New Jersey have launched online gambling sites, and only two sportsbooks in Nevada have followed suit. However, more casinos and sportsbooks are expected to offer online gambling eventually.

If you do decide to gamble online, there are a few things you need to know about new jersey’s gaming regulations. First of all, you’ll need to be physically located within New Jersey’s borders in order to gamble – you can’t do it from your couch at home! Secondly, you’ll need an account with one of the approved gaming sites. And finally, you’ll need to be at least 21 years old.

#  Fifth State Adopts Online Gambling Legislation

The Nevada State Assembly recently voted in favor of online gambling legislation, making it the fifth state to do so this year. The bill, which now heads to the Senate for approval, would legalize internet poker and other casino games within the state.

Backers of the measure say it will help spur economic growth and create jobs, while opponents argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction problems. If approved, Nevada would join New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Michigan in legalizing some form of online gambling.

"With gaming already being our biggest industry, this is a common-sense way to increase its competitiveness and spur even more economic activity in our state," said Assemblyman Ira Hansen, a sponsor of the bill.

Under the proposal, only registered Nevadans would be allowed to gamble online, and operators would be required to pay a 35% tax on their net income. The measure also includes provisions aimed at preventing problem gambling, including a ban on using credit cards to deposit funds and limits on how much people can bet each day.

Governor Brian Sandoval has not yet indicated whether he supports the bill, but has voiced his support for online gambling in the past. "I am supportive of all forms of gaming that are currently available in Nevada," he said last year. "If there is an expansion of gaming that is good for our economy and creates jobs, I am interested."

The potential impact of legalized online gambling on Nevada's economy is still being studied. A recent report by the University of Nevada Las Vegas found that if internet poker were made legal in the state, it could generate up to $Lic million in annual revenue.

#  California Poised to Legalize Online Gambling

California is on the cusp of becoming the latest state to legalize online gambling, with Governor Jerry Brown expected to sign a bill into law that would authorize poker, blackjack and other games to be played via the internet.

The bill, SB466, would establish a regulatory framework for online gambling in California, allowing licensed operators to offer games to residents within the state. The legislation has already passed the State Assembly and Senate, and now only requires the signature of Governor Brown before it becomes law.

Supporters of the bill argue that it will help to generate much-needed revenue for the state, while opponents claim that it could lead to addiction and other harmful consequences. Nevertheless, with Governor Brown expected to sign it into law, online gambling is on track to become legal in California later this year.

Online gambling is already legal in a number of states around the country, including Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey. California is by far the largest state to legalize online gambling, and if the bill is signed into law, it could set a precedent for other states to follow suit.

#  More States Poised to Legalize Online Gambling

A growing number of states are considering legalizing online gambling, as the industry continues to grow at a rapid pace.

This year, Illinois became the latest state to legalize online gambling, joining Pennsylvania and New Jersey. More states are expected to follow in the coming years, as the industry continues to grow at a rapid pace.

Online gambling is now legal in 10 states, and is projected to generate $6.7 billion in revenue this year. By 2023, that number is expected to grow to $13.8 billion.

The growth of the online gambling industry can be attributed to several factors, including the increasing popularity of mobile gaming and the expansion of legal sports betting.

In addition, many states are seeing an increase in tax revenue from online gambling. In New Jersey, for example, online gambling generated more than $120 million in tax revenue last year.

Legalizing online gambling is also seen as a way to combat illegal betting operations. By legalizing and regulating the industry, states can better control how it is operated and ensure that players are protected from fraud and abuse.

All indications point to continued growth for the online gambling industry in the years ahead. As more states legalize it, we can expect to see even greater growth in both revenues and jobs.

 adventurers, your next challenge is about to begin!

This guide is for those seeking to conquer Iowa's 50th dungeon roulette. This dungeon is filled with many deadly traps and challenges that stand in your way. But worry not, with this guide you'll have all the tips you need to make it through!

The first step is to know what you're up against. This dungeon is a randomly generated labyrinth, so there's no telling what you'll find inside. That means you'll need to be prepared for anything.

The second step is to stock up on supplies. You'll want plenty of healing potions and antidotes, as well as weapons and armor suited for the traps ahead.

Once you're ready, it's time to enter the dungeon! The first room is always the easiest, so take advantage of it and stock up on supplies if you need to. Then it's time to move on to the next room.

The rooms in this dungeon can be divided into three main types: traps, puzzles, and enemies. Each room can have a mix of all three, so be prepared for anything.

Traps are usually easy to avoid, but they can deal some serious damage if you're caught off guard. Make sure you know where they are before proceeding through a room.

Puzzles can be difficult but rewarding once solved. They usually involve finding a specific item or using your environment in some way. If you get stuck, don't be afraid to use a hint.

Enemies can be tricky but thankfully there aren't many of them. Take them out quickly and efficiently and be careful not to get surrounded.

The final step is making it to the treasure chest at the end! Be sure to take everything with you before leaving - you never know what might come in handy later on.

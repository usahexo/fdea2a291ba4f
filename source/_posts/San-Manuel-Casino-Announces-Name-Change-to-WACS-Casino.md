#  San Manuel Casino Announces Name Change to WACS Casino

The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians has announced that their casino will be changing its name to the WACS Casino. This comes as part of a larger rebranding effort by the tribe, which also includes a new logo and website.

The WACS Casino will offer gaming, food, and entertainment options for guests, with the goal of providing an unforgettable experience. The tribe is also working on developing a new hotel on the property.

“We are incredibly excited about this next chapter in the San Manuel story,” said tribal chairman Lynn Valbuena in a statement. “The WACS Casino will be a world-class destination, and we can’t wait to welcome our guests.”

The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians is one of the largest tribes in California, with over 4,000 members. The tribe has been operating its casino since 1991, making it one of the oldest in the state.

#  San Manuel Casino Renames Itself the WACS Casino

The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, owners of the San Manuel Casino in Highland, California, have announced that they are renaming their casino the WACS Casino.

The new name pays tribute to the tribe's ancestors, the Washoe and Paiute tribes, who were among the first to settle in the area now known as California. The Washoe people are a Northern Paiute tribe closely related to the Maidu and Miwok people.

"The WACS Casino is more than just a new name for our casino," said Carlos Arballo, Chairman of the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians. "It's a celebration of our shared heritage and a commitment to the future of our tribe and our community."

In addition to the new name, the casino has also undergone a major renovation. The gaming floor has been expanded and upgraded with new machines and games, and there is now a full-service bar and lounge.

"We're proud to open our doors to the WACS Casino and invite everyone to come experience all that we have to offer," said Arballo. "From our world-class gaming floor to our delicious food options, we have something for everyone."

#  San Manuel Casino Goes by WACS Casino Name Now

The San Manuel Casino is one of the most popular casinos in California and it is now known as the WACS Casino. This change was made to help the casino stay modern and keep up with other casinos in the area.

There are a few big changes that are coming with this change. The first is that the name change will help to unify all of the different casino properties that are currently owned by the WACS group. This will make it easier for players to know where they can find the casino properties and it will also make it easier for players to know what each property offers.

Another big change coming with the name change is that there will be a new loyalty program that is being introduced. This loyalty program will be known as Kudos and it will offer players a number of different benefits. Some of the benefits that players can expect include free play, dining discounts, hotel discounts, and more.

Players who are already members of the My Club rewards program will be transitioned over to Kudos automatically. However, players who are not members of the My Club rewards program can sign up for Kudos at any time. In order to sign up for Kudos, players simply need to visit the casino’s website and create an account.

The WACS Casino is hoping that these changes will help to attract more players to its properties. So far, the casino has seen a positive response from players and it looks like these changes were definitely worth making.

#  The San Manuel Casino is Now Officially Called the WACS Casino

The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians has announced a new name for their casino in Highland, California. The tribe is changing the name from the San Manuel Casino to the WACS Casino, which stands for the Wappo-Achomawi-Cache and Miwok Tribes of Northern California.

The new name is a way to honor the tribes that are the original inhabitants of the area where the casino is located. The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians is made up of members of three different tribes: the Wappo, Achomawi, and Cache tribes. The Miwok tribe is also represented in the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians.

The WACS Casino will still offer all of the same gaming and entertainment options as the San Manuel Casino. In addition to slot machines and table games, there will be a variety of restaurants and bars, as well as live music and other entertainment options.

The new name for the casino coincides with several other changes that are taking place at the resort. A new hotel tower is currently under construction, and when it opens in 2020 it will be among the tallest buildings in San Bernardino County. The new hotel tower will add 400 rooms to the casino resort, along with 50,000 square feet of meeting and event space.

The renovations at WACS Casino are part of a larger effort by the tribe to revitalize its economy and create jobs for its members. With more than 2,500 members, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians is one of the largest tribes in California.
